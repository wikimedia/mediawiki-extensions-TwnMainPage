This file contains the descriptions of the tags we use.

@login
  This test logs in. You can filter these tests out if you don't have an
  account available.

@reset-preferences-after
  This test changes user preferences and resets them at the end. In theory you
  could use your normal user account if you skip these tests, but I would not
  recommend doing that.
